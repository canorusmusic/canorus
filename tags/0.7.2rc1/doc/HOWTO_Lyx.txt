Hints for using lyx for Canorus documentation
=============================================

Canorus Style ? (LaTeX, Logo etc.) for every doc for identification
License ? (Common License type similar to GPL)

Main document:
- Contains all documents (including plugin docs etc.)
- Using "include" way to integrate sub documents
- New page for every sub document automatically created
- includeonly line can be created by cmake if some plugins
  or parts of canorus are not built.
