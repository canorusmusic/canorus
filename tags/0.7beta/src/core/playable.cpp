	\class CAPlayable
	\brief Playable instances of music elements.

	CAPlayable class represents a base class for all the music elements which are
	playable (timeLength property is greater than 0). It also adds other properties
	like the music length (whole, half, quarter etc.), number of dots and instead
	of contexts, playable elements voices for their parent objects.

	Notes and rests inherit this class.
