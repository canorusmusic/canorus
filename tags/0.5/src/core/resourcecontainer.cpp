	\class CAResourceContainer
	\brief Resource manipulation class inherited by CADocument, CASheet etc.
	
	This class is used for creation of new resources out of files on the disk.
	Resources are rarely created directly, but are almost always part of the document
	(eg. audio file of the whole score), sheet (eg. audio file of a theme),
	staff (eg. svg images in contemporary music), voice etc.
	This class is inherited by CADocument, CASheet etc., so you can simply add a
	resource by calling
	CASheet::addResource( "/home/user/title.jpeg" );
	
	CAResourceContainer takes care of creating copies for non-linked resources.
	It picks a random unique name for a new resource in the system temporary file.
