== Quick instructions for translators ==

This directory contains translation files for all the supported languages by
Canorus. All translation files having *.ts extension are automatically detected
and compiled into application.

To add a new translation, simply copy template.ts to a file named your ISO
language code and region ending with .ts extension (eg. de_DE.ts for German-
speaking Germans) and translate it using Qt Linguist or other compatible tool.
After rebuilding the project the new translation should become immediately
visible when running Canorus with appropriate locale variables set.

Thanks for your effort!
