	\class CAUndo
	\brief Undo/Redo support

	This class implements undo and redo Canorus functionality.

	The object is usually created upon Canorus startup and is accessed via CACanorus::undo(). Every main
	window which wants to have undo and redo capabilities should have one undo stack for its document. Undo
	stack consists of one or more undo commands called upon undo/redo events (commands actions then make
	changes to the actual documents).

	Here, undo stack is implemented as a pair of QList<CAUndoCommand*> and an index of the current undo
	command (ie. the command which gets called next time the user presses the Undo button).

	Usage of undo/redo:
	1) Create undo stack when creating/opening a new document by calling CAUndo::createUndoStack()
	2) Before each action (insertion, removal, editing of elements), call CAUndo::createUndoCommand() and
	   pass the current document to be saved for that action.
	3) If the action was successful, commit the command by calling CAUndo::pushUndoCommand(). If not, do
	   nothing - non-pushed commands will get deleted when createUndoCommand() will be issued the next time.
	4) For undo/redo, simply call CAUndo::undoStack()->undo().
	5) When destroying the document, also destroy the undo stack (which also destroys all its commands) by
	   calling CAUndo::deleteUndoStack(). This is not done automatically because CADocument is part of the
	   data model and CAUndo part of the controller.
