Keyboard Preferences smplayer
=============================

smplayer Keyboard / Mouse preferences can be changed via 
Options -> Preferences -> Mouse and Keyboard

prefinput.ui:
Keyboard tab is empty in UI file
Mouse tab is filled with some UI stuff
(work done in prefinput.cpp)

actioneditor.h/cpp
Based originally on qq14 (qt3) this is now a qt4
class used to load/save and edit the keyboard settings

Keyboard dialog:
for input of a new shortcut shortcutgetter.h/cpp is used

Canorus Action settings
=======================
Save is done in CASettings (currently only one method)
CAActionEditor (not CAKeyboardEditor)
(alternative CAControlEditor)

Midi settings:
3-4 separate parameters for one command
input could be changed below the action list

Grouping: Group selection via Combobox list ?
Groups could even be editable somewhen

Profile:
Save/Load of profiles for
a) Keyboard settingssu
b) Midi instrument settings

Tooltips: Every command is explained via tooltip.
-> No separate column needed for explanation

Editing of shortcut alternatives:
a) double click opens a shortcut dialog
b) open kind of sub menu for editing inside table/listview
c) edit line: below table/listview there is one line similar to dialog from a)
dependent on context (keyboard/midi editing) only keyboard or midi
profile can be save (label should state the context)
context change via combox or radio buttons 


Context of command has to be taken care of too so shortcuts
can be used more than one time (group ?) like edit/play mode

Macros have to be listed as well
