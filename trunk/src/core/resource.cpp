	\class CAResource
	\brief Different resources included in the file

	CAResource is a wrapper for any file included or linked from the document
	itself. Resource files are usually the recorded midi files, transcripts of
	the score in a pdf format, audio and video files, score in other formats,
	images in the score etc.

	CAResource contains a valid path (_fileName) to the actual file. If the
	resource is external (not included in file), _linked is True and a _fileName
	is the absolute path of the linked file. If the resource is internal (included
	in the file), _linked is False and a _fileName is an absolute path to the extracted
	file in the system temporary directory.
