	\class CAFile
	\brief File import/export base class
	
	This class brings tools for manipulating with files and streams (most notably import and export).
	Classes CAImport and CAExport inherit this class and implement specific methods for import and export.
	
	All file operations are done in a separate thread. While the file operations are in progress user
	can poll the status by calling status(), progress() and readableStatus() for human-readable status
	defined by the filter. Waiting for the thread to be finished can be implemented by an endless busy-wait
	isRunning() function or by catching one of the signals emitted by children import and export classes.
