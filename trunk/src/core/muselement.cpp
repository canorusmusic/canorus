	\class CAMusElement
	\brief An abstract class which represents every music element in the score.
	
	This class is a base class for every music element in the score.
	Music elements can be of various types, note, rest, barline, clef, lyrics syllable,
	function marking, figured bass marking etc.
	See CAMusElementType for details.
	
	Every music element belongs to a so called parent area in the score called context. 
	See CAContext for details.
	
	Since Canorus tends to be built in Model-View-Controller style, every music element
	has one or more of its drawable instances. These classes are named CADrawableClassName,
	where ClassName is type of the music element. eg. CADrawableClef, CADrawableBarline etc.

	\enum CAMusElement::CAMusElementType
	
	Includes different types for describing the CAMusElement:
		- Note - A music element which represents CANote.
		- NoteBracket - A music element which represents CANoteBracket (the bracket which connects the stems).
		- Chord - A virtual music element which represents CAChord.
		- Rest - A music element which represents CARest.
		- BarLine - A music elemnet which represents CABarLine.
		- Clef - A music element which represents CAClef.
		- TimeSignature - A music element which represents CATimeSignature.
		- KeySignature - A music element which represents CAKeySignature.
		- Slur - A music element which represents CASlur.
		- Tie - A music element which represents CATie.
		- PhrazingSlur - A music element which represents CAPhrazingSlur.
		- ExpressionMarking - A music element which represents any technical text markings about how the score should be played - CAExpressionMarking (eg. Legato)
		- VolumeSign - A music element which represents any volue sign (forte, piano etc.).
		- Text - A music element which represents any text notes and authors additions to the score. (eg. These 3 measures still need to be fixed)

	Returns 0, if the music elements are exact; -1 if the music element type differs;
	otherwise number greater than 0.
	
	This method is usually used when opening a score document where music elements are
	written in various voices (eg. barlines), but are eventually merged and written only
