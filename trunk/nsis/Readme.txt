Canorus Windows builds:
1) Configure Canorus with cmake and set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to nsis/canorus directory.
2) Compile the project with make and install it (this will install it to nsis/canorus).
3) Create an executable .exe installation with Nullsoft installer by using nsis/setup.nsi configuration script.
