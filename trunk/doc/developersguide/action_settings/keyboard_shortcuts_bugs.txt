Bugs I encountered when starting to try out keyboard shortcuts
==============================================================
- Conflicts: No conflict column; instead show dialog when conflict
  occurs (ToDo)
- Conflicts:  When reading settings, show one (or a list of)
  commands with conflicting shortcuts. Tell that these got removed.
  Handling: First wins ?!
  Remaining conflicts: Mark red, delete shortcut
  -> Red marking:  Would be removed when either Ok or Apply is pressed
- Conflicts: If happens while loading application
  -> Popup settings dialog

- Editing: Seems not to work (dialogue is not opened)
- Focus: The whole line should be selected instead of only column
- Focus: Tab on SettingsDialog changes to button instead of editor
  (Tab Sequence is not correct)
- Pressing Enter does not open the Edit Shortcut dialog
- On this dialog pressing "Cancel" should not cancel whole Settings
  (Same of course for "Ok")

- Midi: No default midi commands are shown (Somewhere in MidiImport?)
- Midi: No midi shortcuts are shown (same)
- Midi Input: Not connected to editor yet (MidiImport too)
