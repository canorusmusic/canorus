Instructions for translators
============================

This directory contains all currently supported translations of Canorus. Files
having .ts extension are automatically detected and compiled into the
application.

To synchronize translations with the terms in the source, run
```bash
make tr
```

This will update all existing translations and update template.ts used as a
template for a new language. To add a new language, copy template.ts to ISO
language code and optionally region with .ts suffix (eg. fr.ts or fr_TN.ts for
French-speaking Tunisians) and translate it using Qt Linguist or other
compatible tool. After rebuilding the project with
```bash
make
```

the new translation should become immediately visible when running Canorus
with appropriate locale variables set, for example:
```bash
LANG=fr ./canorus
```

Thanks for your effort!
